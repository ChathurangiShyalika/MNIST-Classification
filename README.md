# MNIST-Classification
Classification of MNIST using python tensorflow using multi layer perceptron algorithm. Includes Fully Connected neural network, Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization, Dropout, L1 &amp; L2 Regularization techniques.

The MNIST dataset is a dataset of handwritten digits, comprising 60 000 training examples and 10 000 test examples. The dataset can be downloaded from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

This repository elaborates on the techniques in deep learning that is used for classifying the MNIST data set.

Following technologies are adopted in order to classify the MNIST dataset.

Python- Python version python-3.5.4-amd64 was used.

Tensorflow- Tensorflow version 1.11.0 was used.

IDE- PyCharmIDE

Six deep learning techniques was used. They are

I. Fully Connected Network

II. Batch Normalization

III. Layer Normalization

IV. Dropout

V. L1 Regression (Lasso Regression)

VI. L2 Regression (Ridge Regression)
